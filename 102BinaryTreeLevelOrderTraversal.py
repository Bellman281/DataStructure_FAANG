102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. 
(i.e., from left to right, level by level).

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]

Solution: 
Breadth First SearchÂ (BFS)
We scan through the tree level by level, following the order of height, from top to bottom.
The nodes on higher level would be visited before the ones with lower levels.
